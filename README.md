Check out branch `javascript` for the previous javascript version, and check out branch `stack-based` for an attempt to turn this into a stack-based version which supports lazy iteration and doesn't stack overflow on deeply nested sequences, and check out `flex-bison` for an implementation which tries to use flex and bison and ultimately fails.
